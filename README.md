# p_turnover_cerrado
Scripts for running GDM analyses of phylogenetic turnover as in Azevedo et al (2021).

In the R script "phylo_turnover_azevedo_2021_JBI.R" you'll find how to produce Table 3 and Figure 1 and how to calculate total contributions of geography, environment and geo+env in GDM models.

In the R script "Fig_2_GDM_maps_Azevedo_2021_JBI.R" you'll find how to produce Figure 2 for the clustering of phylogenetic turnover.

The data needed for running all analyses are contained in the file cerrado_layers.rds (same file as in the Dryad repository).
